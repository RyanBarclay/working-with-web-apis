    TODO: copy the code from part2, which you will have modified
    in part3 to talk to your own Dialogflow agent.

    See server/api.py for the changes you need to make for this part of the exercise.
    Depending on what your agent's response looks like after you update the server,
    you might have to tweak the code for getting the Spotify URI out of the response.
